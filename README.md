Dumbo Pinnochio

Your wooden gods are not boys! They shout!

The old man and his wooden trans gods got their stuff together including the cat and the fish but itâ€™s a gay fish and the cat is in remission.

The evil fairy of death Emma Roberts cast a spell on the woods long before even the old man had a house in this town. She cast the spell once similar to the spell that made the three wooden spirits alive!!!!!!!!!!!!

Over the wood there was a great fire. Long ago, the wood caught on fire. All of the earth was killed except the lizards and snakes and insects. The wood was not supposed to survive in any way but some made itâ€™s way out during an expansion of the kingdom.

Inside the three trans wooden gods, there lived the remnant of a vein. A deep deep vein. An evil source that looks just like the wood that surrounds it. It breaths and it vibrates. The trans wooden gods think they have hearts. They never had hearts. They were never boys!

The family walks together towards a boat always off in the distance. They pass through the towns people. Many seeing the trans wooden gods and truly loving them but they are leaving for somewhere on this boat now with father.
